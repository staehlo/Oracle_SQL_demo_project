# Oracle_SQL_demo_project

Design and implemention of a database schema as part of a beginner's course on Oracle SQL. The topic for this database was taken rather arbitrarily. If you are interested in literature you might want to look at the content as well :)

The project description and the book names are in German as the course was taught in this language.
